This is a very simple implementation of the OLE and XLS
specifications. It only provides read access for Excel
BIFF8 streams (other versions might work, although
BIFF4 and earlier probably will not work anyway).

The library also contains an OLE reader to read the
actual OLE containers produced by Excel.
